								<h2>How I became interested in photography</h2>
							</header>
							<p>I love taking photos from behind the lens and it's then I get to see the world, nature, people, events in a whole new way. I get a massive insspiration of nature and it would easily be the driving force behind my photography, creativity.</p>
							<p>I have picked up my first camera at the end of 2011, originally I was trying to get better photo compared to my point and shoot camera. I soon found out I was taking more photos of everything else as well, and thus a completely new hobby was born much to my surprise.</p>
							<p>I taught myself through photography books, online tutorials, great friends and most importantly trial and error. Im always learning, taking on board every shoot I go on, always striving to better my craft in anyway I can.</p>
